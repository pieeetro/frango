#La licenza del sito: the unlicense.

class: center, middle
The Unlicense is a template for dedicating your software to the public domain.
--


Why? Because you have more important things to do than enriching lawyers or imposing petty restrictions on users of your code.
To opt out of the copyright industry's game altogether and set your code free.

## What is it?
  A simple, in-browser, Markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS, featuring:
- Markdown formatting, with smart extensions
- Presenter mode, with cloned slideshow view
- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages
- Slide scaling, thus similar appearance on all devices / resolutions
- Touch support for smart phones and pads, i.e. swipe to navigate slides
---
  ## Why use it?
As the slideshow is expressed using Markdown, you may:
- Focus on the content, expressing yourself in next to plain text not worrying what flashy graphics and disturbing effects to put where
As the slideshow is actually an HTML document, you may:
- Display it in any decent browser
- Style it using regular CSS, just like any other HTML content
- Use it offline!
As the slideshow is contained in a plain file, you may:
- Store it wherever you like; on your computer, hosted from your Dropbox, hosted on Github Pages alongside the stuff you're presenting...
- Easily collaborate with others, keeping track of changes using your favourite SCM tool, like Git or Mercurial
